For some of us the decision to be a software developer is easy and clear cut. However for others is a tough decision and it probably wasnt our first initial choice. For me personally I was always good with tech from a very young age I always liked trying to "modify" my video games on the computer as a teenager and finding new more creative ways to get it to do what I wanted. As I grew up I discovered other things such as cars and due to some life circumstances and it being a quick route to making decent fair money I decided to attend a college program for Automotive technology learning how to work on diag and repair vehicles properly. After years in the automotive industry I began to feel myself getting bored and not really exercising my critical thinking and problem solving abilities very often.  I thank began speaking with some friends of mine who pursued a path in programming using their CS (computer science) degrees. after speaking with them and learning about what they did and how they loved what they did I began researching how to program or how to code. 

**where my programming began**

I stumbled upon a site most of us have probably heard of....Code academy.  I quickly began going through lesson after lesson learning as much as I could trying to build crappy ideas and projects of my own with little success and lots of headaches but still something kept pulling me back in.  After being somewhat competant or so I thought. I learned alot about what I wanted to pursue and the next path I wanted to go down in life was at first I thought I wanted to be a hacker you know like you see on TV with the hoodie and sweatpants with code flying by faster than you can keep up with but after realzing thats not really super realistic I began thinking more and more about what it was I really wanted. 

**Whats important to me **

after dozens more attempts at making projects that worked but not well. I found the thing most important to me is being able to create things and solve problems that most people would quickly give up on after realizing what they're in for. I need a challenge and for me coding provides that challenge of complex problem solving.  although I dont know everything im always willing to adapt and learn something new and that why I decided to learn softare development.
