The CLI project was one of the most intimidating project I think I've ever had. If I had to give 1 tip for getting this project done quickly and in a timely manner I would say. Make sure you have you local environment set up this is where I wasted and lost the most time. 

I found this Link helpful for doing the heaving lifting of getting the local environment mostly set up.

for most people if you follow the instructions this link will walk you 98% of the way through it however, I had quite a few issues getting the proper permissions set up to actually allow me to execute the code I had written. being on a time crunch and needing to have something to submit for fear of missing my deadline I made my project without actually running it untill after I had submitted it. I dont advise this but do what you have to do right? 

My first problem was getting an idea of what I wanted  to do for a project what even was a CLI and how do I make one. so after researching and viewing some of the example and actually doing my homework I 1 realized that CLI was just a command line interface similar to a few labs we've already had to do. After realizing what I had to do and what my guide lines are I than began putting thought into what I wanted to make 1 helpful tip i can offer is pick your API's first and plan you cli around your apis because theyre going to do most of the heavy lifting in your project. 
so I decided to make something kind of fun although mostly useless in reality

my project idea was to have a program that pulls from 2 apis and give 1 set of input it will return a dad joke and given another set of inputs it would return the best joke of all time a terrible Chuck Norris joke. so now that I had my apis which you can view here 
"https://icanhazdadjoke.com/"
"http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random"

setting up the API is relatively simple getting to return what you want is a little more complicated but if you use JSON.parse in my isntance it makes life way way easier. 

the actual CLI class file that links everything together isnt as difficult as you might think once you really think about what you want it do for reference you can view what I did here in my first CLI project although its not my proudest moment it is what I ended up submitting in the time crunch that I had another good tip is dont procrastinate this project get it done as early as you can! https://github.com/FreeRunner34/JokeFactory

so all in all the things I found to be the most challenging about this project is that 
1: make sure your local envirnment is set up long before this project is due so you know it works and you know how to use it. 
2: find you API's first 
3: Plan you project around the API's you wanna use 
4: DONT PROCRASTINATE
5: Take the time to plan out what you want you ruby gem to accomplish 
6: Don't be scared to use binding pry it makes retrieving the information you want so much easier
